      <p>So I really like to play soccer and basketball at school. I play for a soccer
         team and I just play basketball for fun. You can learn a bit more about that
         in the sports page. Anyway, my favorite subject is math. I learn a lot of more
         complicated math with other classes. It is just so interesting to do formulas
         and learn new things. As a matter of fact I made a quadratic formula calculator
         on the test page. Go and see it for yourself. My favorite food is chicken caeser salad.
         I love having croutons, lettuce, and chicken together. It just is a really 
         good taste. Sadly, that is all I can do for now, but I will add more later. :)
