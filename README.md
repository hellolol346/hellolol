# hellollol.com website

Welcome to my project where I store the code for my website.

## MacOS / Linux Installation

1. Launch the **Terminal** app, perhaps from Finder.

2. Navigate to a directory (or folder) where you'd like to dump your project files.

   ```
   cd Project
   ```

3. Copy the project from Github over to your computer.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:hellolol346/hellolol.git
   ```

4. Navigate to the newly created project directory.

   ```
   cd hellolol
   ```

5. Install the libraries and files you need for your setup. This will create a folder
   called `node_modules` which will hold all the tools you depend on.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Start the dev process.

   ```
   npm start
   ```
